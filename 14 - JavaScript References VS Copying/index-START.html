    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    let copy = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    
    copy.push('Liz');

    // now here is the problem!
    
    //console.table(players);
    //console.table(copy);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const safeCopy = players.slice();
    console.table(safeCopy);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    let goodCopy = [];
    goodCopy.concat(players);
    //console.table(goodCopy);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    let gooderCopy = [...players];
    //console.table(gooderCopy);
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const dude = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const human = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
